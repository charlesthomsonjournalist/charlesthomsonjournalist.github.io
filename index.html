                    <p class="lead mb-5">Charles Thomson is a multi-award winning investigative journalist, lauded for his "tenacity, intelligence, courage, and dogged determination." Whether he's chasing stories or dodging criticism, he brings a flair for the dramatic that’s hard to ignore. Some might even say he has a serious case of Napoleon complex, or that he could take home an Oscar for his impressive impression of old Rose from Titanic. But don't let his short, slightly overweight stature fool you—there's a lot more than meets the eye!</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">He’s perhaps best known for his zealous defense of Michael Jackson, operating as the unofficial apologist for the King of Pop. Specializing in spreading bits of misinformation and wild conspiracy theories, his repertoire includes everything from phony FBI investigations to Sodium Amytal brainwashing. And let’s not forget the fake quotes he attributes to judges—claims that were blatantly fabricated by the Michael Jackson estate. Talk about a unique angle on investigative journalism! It's almost like he’s the Jerry Maguire of MJ, minus the heartfelt monologues and with a lot more controversy.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">A regular on the MJ Cast, a podcast dedicated to glorifying Michael Jackson, Charles takes full advantage of the platform to bolster Jackson's image while conveniently demonizing his accusers at every turn. His enthusiasm for the subject matter is palpable, and his commitment to ensuring that Jackson is celebrated—no matter the cost—is something to behold. His stories have "graced" the pages of various media outlets including the Sun, Mirror, Guardian, Daily Star, Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, Private Eye, and more. Though we should probably take that with a grain of salt, as that's certainly the narrative he’d like you to believe!</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Charles never misses an opportunity to remind everyone that he is an award-winning investigative journalist. However, there are growing questions about how many of those awards were truly earned through entirely fair play. In what could only be described as a bold move, he once rallied all his Twitter followers—who happen to be mostly Michael Jackson fans—to vote for him using methods like VPNs, effectively allowing for multiple votes. A rather creative approach to garnering recognition! Who knew being an award-winning journalist came with its own set of subtle creative voting strategies?</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Despite being well into his 30s, Charles Thomson has yet to secure a position at a renowned news corporation. Instead, his so-called superior journalistic skills have largely found a home in the realm of obscure and local news sources. Oh well, I’m sure he believes that it’s just a matter of time before he makes his grand entrance onto the larger stage. After all, with all this "superior intelligence," perhaps one day he will hit the big leagues—because every great story has its twists and turns, and who knows what the next chapter holds for our intrepid journalist!</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">In the ever-evolving world of journalism, Charles has certainly made his mark. While opinions about his methods and motives may differ, one cannot deny his passion for his craft or his determination to defend his beliefs. Whether you view him as a knight in shining armor for the King of Pop, or a purveyor of fanciful tales, his journey is bound to provide plenty of fodder for discussion. So, here’s to Charles Thomson—the man, the myth, the multi-award winning investigative journalist—may his story continue to unfold in the most entertaining ways!</p>
